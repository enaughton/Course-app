                        High-end furniture projects are great to dream about.
                        But unless you have a well-equipped shop and some
                        serious woodworking experience to draw on, it can be
                        difficult to turn the dream into a reality. Not every
                        piece of furniture needs to be a museum showpiece,
                        though. Often a simple design does the job just as well
                        and the experience gained in completing it goes a long
                        way toward making the next project even better. Our pine
                        bookcase, for example, features simple construction and
                        it's designed to be built with basic woodworking tools.
                        Yet, the finished project is a worthy and useful
                        addition to any room of the house. While it's meant to
                        rest on the floor, you can convert the bookcase to a
                        wall-mounted storage unit by leaving off the baseboard.
                        You can secure the cabinet to the wall by screwing
                        through the cabinet cleats into the wall studs. We made
                        the case out of materials available at most
                        building-supply dealers and lumberyards, including 1/2 x
                        3/4-in. parting strip, 1 x 2, 1 x 4 and 1 x 10 common
                        pine and 1/4-in.-thick lauan plywood. Assembly is quick
                        and easy with glue and nails, and when you're done with
                        construction you have the option of a painted or clear
                        finish. As for basic tools, you'll need a portable
                        circular saw, hammer, block plane, combination square,
                        tape measure, metal rule, two clamps, nail set and putty
                        knife. Other supplies include glue, nails, sandpaper,
                        wood filler and varnish or paint and shellac. The
                        specifications that follow will produce a bookcase with
                        overall dimensions of 10 3/4 in. deep x 34 in. wide x 48
                        in. tall. While the depth of the case is directly tied
                        to the 1 x 10 stock, you can vary the height, width and
                        shelf spacing to suit your needs. Keep in mind, though,
                        that extending the width of the cabinet may require the
                        addition of central shelf supports.
