                High-end furniture projects are great to dream about. But unless
                you have a well-equipped shop and some serious woodworking
                experience to draw on, it can be difficult to turn the dream
                into a reality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not every piece of furniture needs to be a museum showpiece,
                though. Often a simple design does the job just as well and the
                experience gained in completing it goes a long way toward making
                the next project even better.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our pine bookcase, for example, features simple construction and
                it's designed to be built with basic woodworking tools. Yet, the
                finished project is a worthy and useful addition to any room of
                the house. While it's meant to rest on the floor, you can
                convert the bookcase to a wall-mounted storage unit by leaving
                off the baseboard. You can secure the cabinet to the wall by
                screwing through the cabinet cleats into the wall studs.
              </p>
              <p>
                We made the case out of materials available at most
                building-supply dealers and lumberyards, including 1/2 x 3/4-in.
                parting strip, 1 x 2, 1 x 4 and 1 x 10 common pine and
                1/4-in.-thick lauan plywood. Assembly is quick and easy with
                glue and nails, and when you're done with construction you have
                the option of a painted or clear finish.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for basic tools, you'll need a portable circular saw, hammer,
                block plane, combination square, tape measure, metal rule, two
                clamps, nail set and putty knife. Other supplies include glue,
                nails, sandpaper, wood filler and varnish or paint and shellac.
              </p>
              <p>
                The specifications that follow will produce a bookcase with
                overall dimensions of 10 3/4 in. deep x 34 in. wide x 48 in.
                tall. While the depth of the case is directly tied to the 1 x 10
                stock, you can vary the height, width and shelf spacing to suit
                your needs. Keep in mind, though, that extending the width of
                the cabinet may require the addition of central shelf supports.
